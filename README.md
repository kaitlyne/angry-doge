#ANGRY DOGE

Oh no! Scott's house has been invaded by cats and it's up to our hero, the Magnificent Doge, to save the day! Scott promises to pay the doge after it finishes exterminating the cats, but will Scott keep his promise of riches for the poor doge? Only one way to find out!

The cats get clever as they try to avoid the Doge from destroying them. Also featuring the one and only Scott Friedman!
